Assignment name  : ft_atoi_base
Expected files   : ft_atoi_base.c
Allowed functions: None
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a function that converts the string argument str (base N <= 16)
to an integer (base 10) and returns it.

The characters recognized in the input are: 0123456789abcdef
Those are, of course, to be trimmed according to the requested base. For
example, base 4 recognizes "0123" and base 16 recognizes "0123456789abcdef".

Uppercase letters must also be recognized: "12fdb3" is the same as "12FDB3".

Minus signs ('-') are interpreted only if they are the first character of the
string.

Your function must be declared as follows:

int	ft_atoi_base(const char *str, int str_base);

Assignment name  : ft_range
Expected files   : ft_range.c
Allowed functions: malloc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write the following function:

int     *ft_range(int start, int end);

It must allocate (with malloc()) an array of integers, fill it with consecutive
values that begin at start and end at end (Including start and end !), then
return a pointer to the first value of the array.

Examples:

- With (1, 3) you will return an array containing 1, 2 and 3.
- With (-1, 2) you will return an array containing -1, 0, 1 and 2.
- With (0, 0) you will return an array containing 0.
- With (0, -3) you will return an array containing 0, -1, -2 and -3.
